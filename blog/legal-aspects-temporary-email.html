            <h3>Software Licensing Compliance</h3>
            <p>Using temporary emails to obtain multiple software licenses or circumvent licensing restrictions may violate software license agreements and applicable laws. Users should carefully review software licensing terms before using temporary emails for software-related activities.</p>

            <h2>Criminal Law and Prohibited Activities</h2>

            <p>Using temporary emails to publish defamatory content or invade others' privacy may result in civil liability regardless of the anonymity provided by temporary email services. Users should understand that legal anonymity does not eliminate civil liability for harmful actions.</p>

            <h3>Contract and Business Torts</h3>
            <p>Temporary email usage in business contexts may create liability for breach of contract, unfair competition, or other business torts. Commercial users should carefully consider the legal implications of temporary email usage in business relationships.</p>

            <h2>Evidence and Legal Proceedings</h2>
            <p>Temporary emails may become evidence in legal proceedings, and their temporary nature may create challenges for legal compliance and evidence preservation.

            <h3>Evidence Preservation Obligations</h3>
